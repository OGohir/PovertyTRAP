## PovertyTRAP

# Project Overview

At its core, this app is a tool to foster understanding and empathy. By simulating the challenges of balancing work, income,
housing, family, and basic needs, it sheds light on the difficult decisions and trade-offs that individuals in poverty often confront.
The overall message of the app is to introduce the concept and idea of showing empathy towards the challenges and
complexities that people in poverty may face in their day to day lives. Every decision in the game mirrors real-life situations.
From choosing a job with low income to deciding whether to start a family (and the financial implications of doing so), players
will experience the tough choices faced by those navigating constrained circumstances. Your choices directly influence the
character's well-being. Every decision—managing health, prioritizing basic needs, budgeting for housing—reflects the struggle
to survive on limited resources. By simulating the struggles of balancing work, income, housing, family, basic needs, the app
aims to show real life decisions that people have to make in such situations.
While the game is entertaining, its underlying objective is to promote empathy and understanding. By experiencing the
challenges firsthand, players gain insight into the importance of social support structures and decision-making. The goal of this
app is to inspire action towards supporting vulnerable communities.

# How can a user keep their basic necessities in check such as their house?

    ● Income and Expenses: The player's income from their chosen job determines their ability to afford housing. If the
    income is sufficient to cover housing expenses, the character keeps their house.

    ● Budget Management: The player needs to allocate enough funds from their income to pay for housing costs. If the
    character doesn't have enough income or overspends on other necessities, they might risk losing the house.
    
    ● Decision-Making: Players must make choices that prioritize housing expenses. They might have to balance other
    needs, such as food, health, and family, while ensuring they have enough funds to maintain their home.
    
    ● Consequences of Insufficient Funds: If the character consistently lacks funds to cover housing costs, the game will
    take away the users house, such as that the user is being kicked out until they can pay their due.
    
    ● Adaptability and Planning: Players need to adapt to changing circumstances, unexpected expenses such as kids,
    and plan their finances accordingly to ensure they can afford to keep their house.


## Challenges

1. LibGDX Setup: One of the biggest challenges was setting up libGDX, which was very difficult for me to start up at home. The program would work differently at times, which made me have to learn more code that integerates libGDX terminology.
4. Learning New Code: while coding on libGDX, I had to learn different variances of java which were a bit difficult at first, but helped acheive a very nice outcome of my part of the game, which was the user interactive part.
5. Lag: When I was first done testing out my part of the user interactive parts, there was a n issue with the user click, when I would click onto the button, the bar would change, but it would only change once then go back up to green. To fix this problem, I had to add a timer to each colour of the bar, red yellow and green, in order to time them orderly and remove from the screen after ebing clicked by a button.
